# Project structure
## Presentation : 
To run our code, download the data and put it in the same folder as our files. \
helpers.py: provided helper functions to load the datas and create a submission file. 
## Data processing : 
optimization.py : process data for model by splitting the classes into four groups, replace the -999 values by the NaN value, and replace the 
## Methods : 
implementations.py  : the implementation of 6 methods to train the model.
helper_functions.py : contains the functions we needed to implement the functions in implementations.py. We also added two functions that predict the label given the weights and the dataset. 
## Best model : 
run.py /run.ipynb  : Results using the best model \
finalsubmission.csv : Prediction for the test data with our best model

## Report
report.pdf: a 2-pages report of the complete solution.
